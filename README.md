# UAV localization project

## Overview
This repository hosts the code for the UAV localization project.
The objective is to tackle the UAV localization problem at mmWaves in Urban Scenarios, where tipically GPS (GNSS) localization provides sub-optimal performance.
We will tackle the problem by means of well-known techniques (ToA, TDoA, etc) and deep learning (DL) techniques.

## Getting started
The code has been tested to work on Python 3.7 under Windows 10.

1. Get the code:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/tommyazz/uav-localization.git
    ```

2. Use `pip3` to install the package:
   ```
   cd uav-localization
   pip3 install .
   ```
